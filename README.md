# Machine-Learning-AI-Portfolio
The goal of this repo will be to analyze some of the current research going on within these areas. My objective is understanding the state of the profession for internships in 2027 and beyond. Focus will be in engineering applications in control systems as well as other groundbreaking areas like LLMs. 

Also, I will try to upload mini projects in this portfolio as well to show my competency in Machine Learning for employers, research collaborators, etc.
